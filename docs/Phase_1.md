## Phase 1 - Test Net

### Core (in progress)

**Description**: Create the core functions for communications, encryption systems with ability to swap protocols and define the packet structure.

- [ ] Encryption [Encryption Discussion](Encryption_Discussion.md)
	- [ ] Modularity using base class and use a factory to decide which to use.
		- [ ] AES-512
		- [ ] Kyber
		- [ ] Key Generation 
			- [ ] Storage
- [ ] Communication [Communication Discussion](Communication_Discussion.md)
	- [ ] Packet structure
		- [ ] Packet Handler
		- [ ] Packet Generator
	- [ ] Abstract Communication / Communication Factory
		- [ ] IP Communication
			- [ ] TCP - Validators
			- [ ] UDP - Partners and Clients

---

### Validators

**Description**: Define the validator role and establish inter-validator communication protocols, as well as how validators interact with other user types.

- [ ] Discover Validators Protocol
	- [ ] Check Run rules
	- [ ] Identify Validator States
- [ ] Listen for connections
	- [ ] Handle incoming messages
- [ ] Perception Score
	- [ ] Add
	- [ ] Reduce
- [ ] Test

---

### Owner

Description: Define the run rule's structure created by the chain owner for validators and partners to execute on.

- [ ] Run rule structure
	- [ ] Known Validators
	- [ ] Tokenomics structure - fees / payout period
	- [ ] block generation speed


---

### Partners

Description: Establish rules for partner communication to both validators and clients and run chain owner generated code.

- [ ] Get jobs
	- [ ] Subscribe for jobs by letting validator know we are available
	- [ ] listen using `when`
- [ ] Connect with Client(s)
- [ ] Rules on Storage
	- [ ] Define how storage is handled
		- [ ] plot system
- [ ] Rules on Computation
- [ ] Rules on Access

---

### Clients

Description: Create the client user type and establish protocol for utility request as well as communication to partners.

- [ ] Request jobs
	- [ ] Send job request packet to validator
	- [ ] handle network response
- [ ] Connect with partner
	- [ ] Known partner - TCP
	- [ ] Independent Partner - UDP

---

### Stress Test

Description: Stress the system on a local network and add tests that make each user type malicious to see if they get caught.

- [ ] Intra-network setup
	- [ ] Identify private IPs as well as their roles

---

### Test

Description: Set the validators live on the global network, creating a filter for specific users to interact. Create logs for real time debugging.

- [ ] Bare metal or using a provider for Validator?
	- [ ] What hardware is needed?
- [ ] Set max accounts to 10k


---

### Co-Chains

Description: Implement the pages and Auction house co-chains and test those on the test net to see how content is being sent on chain.

- [ ] Auction House
	- [ ] Define bidding
	- [ ] Define quick swap
	- [ ] Define Digital Asset Creation
- [ ] Pages
	- [ ] Define how a page is made
	- [ ] Define how a page is shared by partners
		- [ ] Sharded
		- [ ] data acquisition (external data)
			- [ ] SQeeL
			- [ ] File / CSV in a set location
	- [ ] Rating system
	- [ ] Define AdCoin
		- [ ] Set token supply to 444 trillion
		- [ ] Make system that allows other chains to use this token. Protocol

---

### Interface

Description: Implement the graphical user interface to allow standard users the ability to interact with the chain using M3L and GSS. 

M3L should be thought of like the structure / skeleton of the page while GSS is the style / skin of that page.  

- [ ] M3L Structure
	- [ ] Structures
		- [ ] Video Library
			- [ ] Player
			- [ ] Collection
			- [ ] Reaction
			- [ ] Thumbnail / Preview
		- [ ] Spreadsheet
	- [ ] Inputs
		- [ ] Keyboard and mouse
		- [ ] Controller ðŸŽ®
		- [ ] Touch
	- [ ] Outputs
		- [ ] Screen
			- [ ] On_Size
		- [ ] Audio
		- [ ] Haptics
- [ ] GSS Structure
	- [ ] Standard Structure Styling
		- [ ] Video
			- [ ] Loading Screen
			- [ ] Animations
			- [ ] Colorization
			- [ ] Highlights

---

### Public

Description: Allow more users to access the test net to stress test the system and see how much storage is needed for receipts.

- [ ] Release account limit to 100k
- [ ] Log bottlenecks and issues / errors
	- [ ] Do we start implementing the Code ledger protocol?
