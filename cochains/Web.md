# Modulr.Web

This whitepaper is still being written as a means of reducing clutter in the core whitepaper. Below is what was in the core section previously so I have a starting point.

---


Modulr.Web (formally Pages) is Modulr’s decentralized Web system, offering a modern alternative to traditional web technologies. Replacing HTML and CSS with **M3L** (Multi-Media Markup Language) and **GSS** (Global Style Sheets), Modulr>Web provides a scalable, efficient, and privacy-centric experience for both creators and users.

**Legacy Domain Protection**

Modulr respects legacy (HTTP) domain names ending in **.com**, **.org**, **.gov**, **.edu**, and **.net**. These domains are reserved exclusively for their rightful owners as registered on the traditional internet to prevent impersonation and fraud. This ensures that trusted brands and institutions retain their identity in the transition to decentralized web technologies.

All other domain types (e.g., **.io**, **.xyz**) are not automatically recognized or reserved within the Modulr ecosystem. This boundary is established to maintain clarity and fairness while minimizing complexity.

#### Key Features:

1. **Efficient Content Delivery**
    
    - **M3L** and **GSS** revolutionize how content is served by allowing updates to individual components rather than entire documents, significantly reducing network load.
    - Dynamic scaling ensures that popular pages are hosted across multiple partners based on demand and region, maintaining uptime and low latency even during high traffic.
    - To learn more about M3L and GSS: [M3L and GSS Documentation](M3L_GSS.md)
2. **Advanced Content Types**
    
    - Unlike HTML, **M3L** supports more advanced content types, such as **video**, **chat**, and **canvas**, enabling developers to build richer, more interactive applications directly on the Pages co-chain.
    - M3L is designed for modularity and efficiency, referencing content locations dynamically rather than embedding them, reducing redundancy and improving scalability.
3. **Tailored User Experience**
    
    - Pages includes a **featured content section** personalized to each user’s interests. This section is fully editable, giving users control over the recommendations they see.
    - Content is also **classified and rated** to ensure users know what to expect from a site. Ratings are especially useful for identifying mature content or categorizing pages by their intended audience.
4. **Page Rating System**
    
    - Users can **rate pages**, helping to maintain honesty and accountability. If creators falsely claim their pages are safer than they are, they receive a penalty to their Reliability score. Similarly, users who submit false negative claims about a page’s rating will also experience a decrease in their Reliability score.
    - Only ratings from users with **reputable Reliability scores** are taken seriously, ensuring the system rewards fairness and transparency.
5. **Privacy by Design**
    
    - By eliminating cookies and intrusive tracking methods, Pages protects user privacy while still providing a seamless browsing experience.
    - The platform leverages decentralized systems to ensure user data remains secure and under their control.
6. **AdCoin: The Native Token**
    
    - AdCoin is the native utility token for Pages, enabling a frictionless user experience. Users can choose to earn AdCoin by interacting with ads, assisting in **Mimic AI model training** (e.g., teaching AI how to draw or solve logical problems), or swap with other in network tokens to support an ad-free browsing experience.
    - AdCoin integration across the network ensures seamless monetization options for creators and users alike.
7. **Age Verification and Content Control**
    
    - The **Adult_Swim Protocol** introduces a decentralized age verification system. Instead of storing user data, it uses markers to verify whether an account holder meets age requirements.
    - Verified entities can grant age status, but any organization providing false records loses its ability to verify accounts, and all associated accounts lose their status. The Modulr organization can act as the default age verifier but primarily delegates this function to trusted entities.
8. **Seamless Integration with Web4**
    
    - Pages works seamlessly with other Modulr co-chains, leveraging **M3L** and **GSS** to enable powerful tools like Mimic-powered assistants. These assistants can guide users through the network, troubleshoot issues, and provide real-time help for specific features in the apps they support.
9. **Content Reaction System**
    
    - Pages includes built-in tools for users to react to and interact with content. This feedback helps site owners gauge audience sentiment and improve their offerings. For example, news articles and videos can be rated positively or negatively, providing valuable insights.

10. **Integrated A / B Testing**

    - Pages provides users the ability to do A / B testing, allowing developers the ability to run two different sites to see which gets the most interaction.
