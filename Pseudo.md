# Documentation Overview

## Chapter 1: Keywords

This chapter introduces and explains the core keywords in Pseudo. Keywords define the syntax and functionality of the language, enabling developers to write reactive, expressive, and structured code.

Key Topics:

- `when`: Reactive programming for event-driven tasks.
- `const`: Declaring constants for immutable values.
- `def`: Defining functions with strict typing.
- `return`: Returning values from functions.
- `let`: Block-scoped variable declaration.
- `import` and `from`: Bringing external modules or components into scope.

## Chapter 2: Built-In Functions

This chapter covers the essential built-in functions in Pseudo that are always available without requiring imports. These functions streamline development by handling common programming tasks.

Key Topics:

- `print()`: Display messages or variables in the console.
- `log()`: Record messages or transactions on the blockchain.
- `len()`: Determine the size of strings, lists, or dictionaries.
- `type()`: Identify the type of a variable or value.
- `input()`: Collect input from users during runtime.
- `int()` and `decimal()`: Type conversions and precise numeric handling.

## Chapter 3: Types

This chapter defines the core and custom data types in Pseudo. Types are the foundation of the strongly-typed nature of the language, ensuring clarity, precision, and safety in all operations.

Key Topics:

- Primitive Types: `i32`, `i64`, `bool`, `str`, etc.
- Custom Types: `decimal`, `address`, `listener`, etc.
- Collections: `list`, `dict`, and nested data structures.
- Type Annotations: Declaring and enforcing variable types.
- Type Casting: Converting between types safely and efficiently.
- Constants and Immutability: Using `const` with types for reliable values.

## Purpose of the Chapters

- Keywords: To provide a clear understanding of Pseudoâ€™s syntax and its core functionalities.
- Built-In Functions: To serve as a reference for utilities that simplify common programming tasks.
- Types: To clarify how data is represented and manipulated in Pseudo, ensuring developers use the right tools for their applications.
